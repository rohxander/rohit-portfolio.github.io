Hi, Iâ€™m **Rohit Prakash** â€” an embedded systems enthusiast, deep tech explorer, and relentless learner.

Iâ€™ve worked at Microchip Technologies where I contributed to robust system tools, and at Exasol AG where I built analytical dashboards that powered IT operations. My core interests lie at the intersection of **embedded software, AI, and system efficiency**.

This site is my digital space â€” where I document my journey, projects, and thoughts on everything from **technology** to **culture and life lessons**.

> "I believe technology should solve problems quietly, with elegance and purpose."
