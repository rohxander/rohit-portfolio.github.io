Hello, I’m **Rohit Prakash** — a systems engineer, deep tech enthusiast, and someone who believes in learning by building.

Currently pursuing my Master's in _Information and Communication Technology_ at FAU Erlangen, I focus on embedded systems, AI, and systems-level engineering. I’ve worked on robust firmware infrastructure at **Microchip Technologies** and built business analytics tools at **Exasol AG**.

This site is my personal corner of the web — where I document ideas, share technical explorations, reflect on culture, and post project insights that matter.

> "Technology should feel like magic — silent, helpful, and purposeful."

Thanks for stopping by. Explore my [blog](/blog/), [projects](/projects/), and feel free to [reach out](/about/#profile).
