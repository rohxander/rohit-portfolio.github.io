I’m **Rohit Prakash**, a passionate technologist and lifelong explorer of complexity.

Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by how things work — not just in engineering or software, but in nature, design, architecture, and thought itself. I’m drawn to systems that demand depth, clarity, and reasoning. Whether it’s an elegant circuit, a layered philosophical idea, or the structural logic behind a Gothic cathedral — I value what challenges the mind and refines the craft.

My background is grounded in information and communication technology, with hands-on experience in embedded systems, data platforms, and applied software. But what defines me isn’t a skillset — it’s an approach. I work with a low-input, high-output mindset. I don’t just complete tasks; I push for clarity, structure, and meaningful improvement.

I believe mediocrity is optional — and curiosity, when paired with discipline, can be a force of creation.

If you’re someone who values thoughtful execution, original thinking, and quiet momentum — we’ll probably get along well.
