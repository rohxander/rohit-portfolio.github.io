I’m **Rohit Prakash**, a Master’s student in _Information and Communication Technology_ at FAU Erlangen, Germany. My passion lies at the intersection of **embedded systems, wireless communication, and artificial intelligence** — especially when applied to real-world problems.

Previously, I worked as an **Application Engineer at Microchip Technology**, where I gained hands-on experience in embedded software and system-level debugging. I’m currently working at **Exasol AG** in Nuremberg as a **Working Student**, where I contribute to IT process optimization and analytics.

My current focus is:

- Building a strong foundation in **low-level firmware development**
- Exploring **LoRa-based IoT systems** for smart waste management (through my startup project)
- Mastering tools like **C/C++, Jekyll, and Power BI**
- Developing a resilient mindset to thrive in both tech and life

> "The Pursuit of Happyness" is more than a movie to me — it’s my reminder to keep fighting, silently and persistently, no matter how hard it gets.
