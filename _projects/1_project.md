As part of my role at Microchip Technology, I was responsible for developing a high-speed UART validation application to test **hardware UART flow control (RTS/CTS)**. The tool was designed to validate signal integrity and reliable communication at baud rates up to **10 Mbps**, with final tests achieving stable operation at **25 Mbps**.

### üîç Problem

Testing true UART hardware flow control proved challenging with standard USB-to-UART converters. Despite using **FTDI cables** with RTS/CTS support, the **PC‚Äôs CTS line remained low**, making the system behave like conventional UART without flow control. Even enabling hardware flow control within **Tera Term** (the initial terminal application used) had no effect ‚Äî likely due to the abstraction layer introduced by the USB interface.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Role & Approach

- Studied PIC32 UART modules in-depth using the reference manual and Harmony v3 framework
- Developed a test firmware application on **WFI32E02** and **PIC32** to evaluate high-speed full-duplex UART
- Identified the baud rate ceiling in Tera Term (~2.5 Mbps) and replaced it with a **Saleae Logic Analyzer** to monitor and verify RTS/CTS transitions at higher speeds
- Debugged scenarios like buffer overruns and misaligned handshaking under stress
- Created reusable documentation and setup guidelines for internal test teams

### ‚úÖ Outcome

The application became part of Microchip‚Äôs internal firmware validation toolset and was used in product-level demos and performance evaluations.

### üîß Tools & Platforms

PIC32, WFI32, MPLAB Harmony v3, MPLAB X IDE, Saleae Logic Analyzer, FTDI Cables, Tera Term
