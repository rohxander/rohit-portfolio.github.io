As part of my role at Microchip Technology, I worked on developing and validating a UART-based communication tool designed to ensure robust high-speed data transfer using hardware flow control.

The application focused on testing UART interfaces at varying baud rates, under real-time operating conditions, while ensuring consistent buffer handling, no data loss, and clean signal behavior â€” especially at 460800 and 921600 bps.

**Objective**  
To validate MCU UART hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) across edge-case timing scenarios, and establish internal tooling for product demos and certification readiness.

**My Role**

- Wrote firmware-level test application using MPLAB Harmony drivers
- Configured and tested hardware UART on WFI32 and PIC32 platforms
- Used oscilloscopes and logic analyzers to monitor RTS/CTS signal integrity
- Logged and resolved buffer overflow edge cases during full-duplex testing
- Created documentation to assist internal teams with porting and reuse

**Tools & Platforms**  
PIC32, WFI32, MPLAB X IDE, MPLAB Harmony, Salea Logic Analyzer, Digital Oscilloscopes
